Courses receiving a �U (Unsatisfactory)� will not earn credit. Courses that are marked �P (Pass)� will also result in credit earned and will not impact your UCF recalculated GPA. However, courses that are marked �F (Fail)� will be viewed as a failing grade and an �F� will be included in your UCF recalculated GPA.

Because there are so many activities for you to choose from, your tour may be shorter than a regular visit, but we’ll squeeze as much information in as possible. Housing tours are self-guided, giving you the flexibility to view only those communities that interest you. We’ll post signs on campus directing you to our housing areas. Once you get there, a member of our housing staff will be on hand to answer questions and show you around. Not every housing community is open, but you’ll be able to view a broad selection. And finally, our guided tours do not include every corner of campus, but we encourage you explore during your free time or after the event concludes."
Can I use my merit scholarship for summer semesters?,"Your merit scholarship does not apply to the first summer semester after high school at UCF. However, students may request future summer semester scholarship disbursements from the Office of Student Financial Assistance."
Do I have to accept my admission offer and put down the deposit before I can apply for housing?,"No. Admitted freshmen can apply for housing as soon as it opens in mid-November. Students have until May 1 to commit and pay the $200 enrollment deposit."
Do I have to register to attend the Admitted Student Open House?,"Yes, each admitted student must register to attend, though parents and other family members can register as guests under one student’s name. Please consult your email invitation for the link to our registration form. We want to make certain that everyone gets the attention they need, and fewer people means more one-on-one attention for you, so we limit space. If you need to cancel, please let us know so we can allow others to attend. A cancellation link appears in the confirmation email from when you signed up."
Do I still need to pay the nonrefundable enrollment deposit if I am offered or accept my scholarship?,"Yes, you must still submit the nonrefundable enrollment deposit even if you are offered or accept your scholarship."
Does UCF offer Study Abroad Programs?,"Study abroad can broaden one’s view of themselves and the world around them.

Please visit UCF Study Abroad for more information about programs and program options."
How can I accept my merit scholarship?,"If you have been awarded a merit scholarship, instructions for accepting your award will be provided through email and written correspondence."
How can I find out what courses or credits will transfer to UCF?,"College-level coursework from other accredited institutions of higher education, meeting university transfer eligibility requirements will transfer to UCF. However, all your credits may not meet the specific requirements of your degree program. The department of your major will determine how these credits will be used and applied toward your degree. UCF currently uses a plus/minus system in calculating a grade point average for transferred coursework. In addition, grade forgiveness is only honored if it has been awarded in conjunction with an A.A. or statewide articulated A.S. degree from a Florida public community college, state college or university. All incoming courses will be reviewed for UCF equivalency once you are admitted. The Transfer Credit Evaluation, located in your myUCF portal (navigate to Student Self Service > Other Academic) will list all courses received at the time of admission as well as any associated UCF equivalencies. For courses without a UCF equivalent, you will have the opportunity to upload a syllabus and the course will be evaluated. You will have limited time to submit syllabi if needed, so you should review the Transfer Credit Evaluation in myUCF at your earliest convenience. UCF has created a convenient transfer equivalency portal to access a database of established course equivalencies from other institutions. While actual awarding of transfer credit occurs after official transcripts are received from the sending institution, the portal can provide guidance as you plan your transition to UCF."
How can I gain readmission if I previously attended UCF?,"Submit your readmission application through the Registrar’s Office. You can contact the office at registrar.ucf.edu or 407-823-3100."
How do I let UCF know that I want to attend?,"Confirm your offer of admission by logging in to your Future Knight Portal.

The enrollment deposit can be submitted online by credit or debit card. Visit our FAQ to learn how to request a waiver of the enrollment deposit on the basis of a financial hardship. Transfer students who have completed 12 or more college credits after high school graduation are not required to submit an enrollment deposit."
How do I obtain/verify Florida residency for tuition purposes?,"Your residency classification is based upon information from your application — documentation of your Florida residency may be required.

How do I submit residency documents to Undergraduate Admissions?,"Once admitted, complete the Residency Declaration Form on your Future Knight Portal checklist. Residency status for tuition purposes will be reflected in myUCF following verification. Once you register for classes, access your fee invoice in myUCF and ensure that the appropriate tuition and fees are assessed."
How is the Admitted Student Open House different from the daily Campus Visit Experience?,"Open Houses for Admitted Students offer more information about UCF’s campus, programs, housing and student life than a regular visit to campus. The daily Campus Visit Experience is a tour of the campus — it’s included in our Open House, but may be condensed due to time constraints. At an Admitted Student Open House, you will also learn about academics, student activities, housing, the LEAD Scholars Program and more, and you’ll have more access to faculty, administrators and current UCF students."
I am not ready to make my final college selection. Should I still accept my merit scholarship offer?,"If you are still evaluating your college options, please request an extension on your scholarship offer. An extension lasts until May 1."
"I have already received a merit scholarship offer from UCF, but I have improved my grades and/or ACT/SAT/CLT.

I've been asked to submit a copy of my SSN to UCF. Why?,"If you receive a request for a copy of your Social Security Card, it means that UCF has a blank or invalid Social Security Number (SSN) on file for you. Not having a valid SSN on file will prevent you from having aid awarded through Florida Bright Futures and/or the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Additionally, a valid SSN is required to process certain third party payments, such as Florida Prepaid. You may upload a copy of your Social Security Card through our secure Qualtrics portal at https://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_daIPksdbz2j64mN. Once received, your student record will be updated within 15 business days."
I've been offered admission. How can I request an enrollment deposit waiver?,"Your $200 non-refundable enrollment deposit and $2 convenience fee is due no later than May 1 for the summer and fall semesters, and December 1 for the spring semester.

"If I accept my scholarship, am I obligated to attend UCF?","No, accepting your scholarship does not obligate you to attend UCF.

Lower-level courses are offered both downtown and on the main campus. If an academic program is based downtown all of the required courses in that degree program are held at the downtown campus or—if offered by the program—online."
Is there a mandatory summer enrollment requirement at UCF?,"Yes. The Florida Board of Governors requires all students who enter a Florida public university with less than 60 semester hours to complete at least nine semester hours prior to graduation by attending one or more summer sessions. University presidents or their designees may waive the application of this regulation in cases of unusual hardship to the individual."

Ok, I’m registered for the Admitted Student Open House. Where do I go and when?,"Once you arrive on our main campus, park in Garage A (free of charge), then walk to the Student Union—there will be signs in place to help you find your way. Once inside, go to the Pegasus Ballroom. Our campus is a walking campus, so there is no transportation between the garage and the Student Union.

What happens if UCF does not receive my final transcripts, test scores or residency documentation?,"Failure to provide final transcripts, official test scores or residency documentation will result in a hold being placed on your account. These holds will affect your ability to adjust your schedule, register for future terms, receive grades or have transcripts sent to other institutions. These holds will also delay the disbursement of financial aid."
What if I am admitted off of the waitlist after the May 1 enrollment deposit deadline?,"It is possible that you will be notified of your decision after the May 1 deadline. This is not unusual for students on the waitlist. If you are admitted, you will be given a new deposit deadline."
What is the difference between a student taking online courses and a student enrolled in a fully online program?,"Students admitted to UCF as campus-based students have complete access to UCF campus-based services and pay full tuition and fees. Campus based students may enroll in both online and campus-based courses. A UCF Online student is a strictly online student who does not attend courses on campus. UCF Online students pay reduced fees and do not have access to all campus based activities such as housing, health services, Recreation and Wellness Center, athletics, etc. UCF Online students may only enroll in online and video streaming courses."

The Priority Scholarship Application Deadline is November 1.

We also value leadership, extracurricular activities and community service, but no single factor guarantees or excludes you from getting a scholarship. We consider each applicant on an individual basis."
How do I appeal a merit scholarship?,"Merit scholarship funding is limited. On average, just 25% of admitted students are offered a merit scholarship. Awarding is based primarily upon the student’s academic credentials. It is typical of students awarded a scholarship to have earned test scores and grades above the incoming fall FTIC average of 1332 SAT, 28 ACT, 95 CLT and 4.25 GPA. Most awardees will have presented only A’s and B’s throughout their high school career, however, no one factor guarantees or excludes a student from being awarded a merit scholarship. Admitted First-Time-in-College (FTIC) students for summer and fall who met the November 1 Scholarship Priority Deadline were evaluated by the Scholarship Committee in the first round of scholarship reviews. If scholarship funding remains after the initial award round, the Scholarship Committee may review admitted FTIC students whose application files were completed after November 1st. Students may submit an appeal to the Scholarship Committee if one of the following conditions are met: You were not awarded a merit scholarship by UCF Undergraduate Admissions and are appealing on the basis of new or updated academic information such as a higher test scores or improved grades. You were awarded a merit scholarship by UCF Undergraduate Admissions and are appealing for a higher award amount on the basis of new or updated academic information such as higher test scores or improved grades. Appeals must include academic credentials that were not available during the initial scholarship review. The deadline to submit a scholarship appeal and supporting documentation was March 15, 2024. All students who have appealed will be notified of their appeal decision by April 1, 2024. Due to limited merit scholarship funding, no scholarship appeals will be accepted after March 15.

I've heard about new legislation for an out-of-state waiver for tuition purposes for nonresident students graduating from Florida high schools.
