In recent years, some Florida high schools and/or districts changed the way class rank is calculated and reported, making it difficult to accurately evaluate and determine students for Top 10 Knights qualification.

Courses receiving a �U (Unsatisfactory)� will not earn credit. Courses that are marked �P (Pass)� will also result in credit earned and will not impact your UCF recalculated GPA. However, courses that are marked �F (Fail)� will be viewed as a failing grade and an �F� will be included in your UCF recalculated GPA. It is important to know which option your school is offering and fully understand the potential consequences of your choices if you are given options for U, S, P or F marks.

Courses marked as pre-AP, pre-IB, pre-AICE and honors are given an additional 0.5 quality point.
